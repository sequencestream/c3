steps:

## Smoke test (permission flow)

- `pnpm start --project /tmp --port 13000`
- `node scripts/e2e/e2e-ws-test.mjs ws://localhost:13000/ws` → expect `RESULT: PASS`.

## Consensus voting test (multi-agent decision)

Exercises the multi-agent consensus flow against the real `~/.c3/settings.json`
agents. Seeds a throwaway coding project in `/tmp`, asks the model to edit a
file (forcing a sensitive tool through the permission gateway), and checks that
voting actually ran — `consensus_auto` (unanimous) or a `permission_request`
carrying a `consensus` outcome (split). Consensus is enabled for the run and the
original settings are restored on exit; the agents are never modified.

Requires at least one agent besides the default (to vote). Hits the configured
providers' APIs (spends real tokens).

- `pnpm build` then `pnpm start --project /tmp --port 13000`
  (or `pnpm dev` and use `ws://localhost:3000/ws`)
- `node scripts/e2e/e2e-consensus-test.mjs ws://localhost:13000/ws` → expect `RESULT: PASS`.

## AskUserQuestion consensus test (per-question answering)

Exercises consensus over an `AskUserQuestion` prompt: the model is asked to pose
one multiple-choice question, the other agents answer it, and the gateway either
auto-answers (`consensus_auto` with `outcome.kind === 'ask'`, all agreed) or
surfaces the answer panel (`permission_request` with `consensus.kind === 'ask'`,
split) which the test fills in. Verifies the answer is injected and the run
completes. Same settings handling as the consensus test.

- `node scripts/e2e/e2e-ask-consensus-test.mjs ws://localhost:13000/ws` → expect `RESULT: PASS`.

## SDK answer-injection spike (one-off)

Standalone proof that AskUserQuestion answers can be fed back via the
`canUseTool` channel in headless mode. Runs the SDK directly (no c3 server),
injecting an `answers` map via `updatedInput` on the allow result and asserting
the model receives it.

- `node scripts/e2e/spike-ask-answer-injection.mjs` → expect `RESULT: PASS`
  (add `--deny` to compare the deny+message fallback path).
