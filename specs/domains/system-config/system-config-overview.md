# Group: system-config

The `system-config` group holds c3's user-managed configuration that is not per-session
bookkeeping. Today it has two domains — **agent-config** (agent profiles) and
**project-config** (per-workspace configuration knobs).

## Domains

| Domain                                                | Responsibility                                                                                                                                | API                                   | Status |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------ |
| [agent-config](agent-config/agent-config-overview.md) | Manage agent profiles (url/key/model + name), the default agent, and per-session agent binding                                                | WebSocket `/ws` (see shared protocol) | active |
| project-config                                        | Per-workspace config knobs (defaultMode, consensus, devSkill, maxRoundsPerStage, maxSpeechChars, gitBranchMode, sandbox, sddEnabled/specPath) | WebSocket `/ws` (see shared protocol) | active |

## Shared context

- Shares the wire protocol in
  [`shared/api-conventions/websocket-protocol.md`](../../shared/api-conventions/websocket-protocol.md)
  (`get_settings`, `save_settings`, `settings`, `load_workspace_setting`, `save_workspace_setting`,
  `workspace_setting`).
- Persists to `~/.c3/settings.json` by default. The path is overridable for isolated launches
  (e.g. e2e) via the `c3 start --settings <path>` CLI flag — it names the exact settings.json file
  and its directory also holds `state.json`, relocating the whole config dir without touching the
  real `~/.c3`. (The `C3_DIR` env var, already honored by the db layer, likewise relocates the dir.)
  Stored under the `projectConfigs` key (a per-workspace-path → workspace-setting map). **All writes
  go through the single, concurrency-safe write path:** in-process serialization + a cross-process
  file lock, with write-time disk re-read and merge-not-overwrite so `save_settings` never wipes
  per-project config. See [persistence](../../shared/data-conventions/persistence.md) (唯一写入路径 + 双层锁，2026-06-08-003).
- Separate from the session-registry's `state.json` (`${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/c3/state.json`).
- **Migration (2026-06-07-017):** `defaultMode` is now a per-vendor map (vendor id → mode token)
  instead of a single mode token. The old single-string format is detected during workspace-setting
  normalization and automatically distributed to each vendor key (the value is used as-is for every
  vendor; each vendor's catalog validation happens at the per-vendor save handler). The read-layer
  one-shot migration of legacy global `defaultMode`/`consensus`/`devSkill`/`maxRoundsPerStage`/`maxSpeechChars`
  into per-project config is unchanged.

## Workspace-setting fields (SDD)

- **`sddEnabled`** — master switch for spec-driven development (SDD) in the workspace.
  Off by default. When on, the SDD spec quality gate and human approval checkpoints
  apply to development tasks before coding starts. Only an explicit boolean `true`
  enables it; absent / non-boolean values normalize to `false`.
- **`specPath`** — directory (relative to the workspace root) where SDD specs are
  stored. Trimmed on read; absent / blank / non-string normalizes to the default
  `.specs`. Path existence and writability are **not** validated at config layer
  (creation is the responsibility of the SDD session-start flow, not config storage).

Both fields are stored under the per-workspace `projectConfigs` map alongside the
other knobs and are always back-filled to their defaults by `normalizeWorkspaceSetting`.
